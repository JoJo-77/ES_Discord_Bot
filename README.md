## Requirements

## Useage 

## Links
 - [Public ES Schedule](https://account.subitup.com/public/?5t7i0fpakJA%3d#byTimeDay)

## Notes
- The website is run through scripts therefore we cannot use webscraping to pull data from the website
- ### Ideas
  - Using a webdriver (I have experience in selenium with python) we can select all the text from the page and parse the resulting text to find schedules
- ### Implementations / Milestones
